# Peter-Answers-Python
I wrote a version of Peter Answers, The Virtual Tarot in Python.

I've written comments inside the .py file so that it would be easy for anyone to understand and make changes to it.
The program is created using the getch command from msvcrt library, if you're a Linux user then most probably this won't work on your system by default because the Microsoft library is not available on Linux by default.
If you're using it, you most probably know that Peter Answers is, to store the answer use comma (,).
